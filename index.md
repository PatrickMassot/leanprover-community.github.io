The [Lean theorem prover](https://leanprover.github.io) is a proof assistant developed principally
by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research.

There has been a community effort to develop [mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib), a
library of mathematics formalized in Lean. This library also contains definitions useful for
programming.

Much of the discussion surrounding Lean occurs in a [Zulip chat room](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com).
Since this chatroom is only visible to registered users, we provide an 
[openly accessible archive](https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive) of the public discussions. This is useful for quick
reference; for a better browsing interface, and to participate in the discussions, we strongly
suggest joining the chat. Questions from users at all levels of expertise are welcomed.
